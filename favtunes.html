[00:00.20] Let Her Go	
[00:26.00] Well you only need the light when it's burning low
[00:30.00] Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
[00:33.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[00:39.00] Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
[00:43.00] Only hate the road when you're missing home
[00:46.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[00:52.00] And you let her go
[01:06.00] Staring at the bottom of your glass
[01:08.00] Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
[01:11.00] But dreams come slow and they go so fast
[01:18.00] You see her when you close your eyes
[01:21.00] Maybe one day you'll understand why
[01:24.00] Everything you touch surely dies
[01:30.00] 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
[01:33.00] Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
[01:37.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[01:43.00] Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
[01:46.00] Only hate the road when you're missing home
[01:50.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[01:57.00] Staring at the ceiling in the dark
[01:59.00] Same old empty feeling in your heart
[02:02.00] Love comes slow and it goes so fast
[02:09.00] Well you see her when you fall asleep
[02:12.00] But never to touch and never to keep
[02:14.00] 'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep
[02:20.00] 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
[02:25.00] Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
[02:28.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[02:34.00] Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
[02:38.00] Only hate the road when you're missing home
[02:41.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[02:46.00] And you let her go
[02:49.00] Oh oh oh no
[02:53.00] And you let her go
[02:56.00] Oh oh oh no
[03:00.00] And you let her go
[03:12.00] Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
[03:16.00] Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
[03:19.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[03:25.00] Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
[03:29.00] Only hate the road when you're missing home
[03:32.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[03:38.00] 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
[03:42.00] Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
[03:45.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[03:52.00] Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
[03:56.00] Only hate the road when you're missing home
[04:00.00] Only know you love her when you let her go
[04:07.00] And you let her go

[00:00.20] Stressed Out
[00:16.50] I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
[00:19.00] I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
[00:22.00] I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
[00:25.00] I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
[00:28.00] I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
[00:30.00] But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
[00:32.50] My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
[00:38.00] My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
[00:45.00] Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
[00:51.00] When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
[00:55.50] (Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
[01:01.00] When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
[01:11.00] We're stressed out
[01:17.50] Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
[01:21.00] How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
[01:24.00] I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
[01:26.00] Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
[01:30.00] It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
[01:32.00] Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
[01:35.00] But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
[01:37.00] Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter
[01:40.50] My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
[01:47.00] My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
[01:53.50] Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
[02:00.00] When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
[02:06.00] (Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
[02:11.00] When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
[02:16.00] We used to play pretend, give each other different names
[02:17.50] We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
[02:21.00] Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
[02:24.00] Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money, " yeah
[02:27.00] We used to play pretend, give each other different names
[02:29.00] We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
[02:32.00] Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
[02:35.00] Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money, " yeah
[02:39.50] Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
[02:44.50] When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
[02:51.00] (Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
[02:56.00] When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
[03:01.00] Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
[03:04.00] We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
[03:06.50] Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
[03:09.50] We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
[03:12.00] Used to play pretend, give each other different names
[03:15.00] We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
[03:17.00] Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face

[00:00.20] Lose Yourself
[00:33.40] Look
[00:36.20] If you had
[00:38.50] One shot
[00:40.00] Or one opportunity
[00:43.10] To seize everything you ever wanted
[00:46.00] In one moment
[00:48.20] Would you capture it
[00:50.50] Or just let it slip?
[00:51.50] Yo
[00:52.80] His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
[00:55.80] There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
[00:58.00] He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
[01:01.00] To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
[01:04.00] What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
[01:07.00] He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
[01:10.00] He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
[01:12.00] The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
[01:15.00] Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
[01:18.00] Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
[01:19.80] He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
[01:23.00] He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
[01:25.10] It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
[01:28.30] He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
[01:33.00] Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
[01:35.00] Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[01:37.00] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[01:40.00] You own it, you better never let it go
[01:43.00] You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[01:45.80] This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[01:48.00] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[01:52.00] You own it, you better never let it go
[01:54.00] You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[01:57.00] This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[01:59.80] You better
[02:00.10] His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
[02:03.05] This world is mine for the taking
[02:05.00] Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
[02:09.00] A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
[02:13.00] It only grows harder, only grows hotter
[02:16.00] He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
[02:18.00] Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
[02:21.00] Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
[02:26.00] He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
[02:28.00] But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
[02:31.00] These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
[02:34.00] They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
[02:38.10] So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
[02:43.00] Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da
[02:44.70] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[02:48.00] You own it, you better never let it go
[02:50.00] You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[02:53.00] This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[02:56.00] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[02:59.00] You own it, you better never let it go
[03:01.00] You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[03:05.00] This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[03:07.00] You better
[03:08.00] No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
[03:10.00] Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
[03:13.00] I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
[03:16.00] I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
[03:19.00] But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
[03:21.00] Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
[03:24.50] All the pain inside amplified by the
[03:27.00] Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
[03:30.00] Five and I can't provide the right type of
[03:33.00] Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
[03:37.00] And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
[03:40.00] This is my life and these times are so hard
[03:42.00] And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
[03:46.00] Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
[03:49.00] Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
[03:52.00] For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
[03:55.00] Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
[03:58.00] To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
[04:00.00] Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
[04:04.00] Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
[04:09.00] So here I go, is my shot
[04:10.00] Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
[04:14.00] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[04:17.00] You own it, you better never let it go
[04:20.00] You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[04:23.00] This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[04:25.00] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
[04:28.00] You own it, you better never let it go
[04:31.00] You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
[04:34.00] This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
[04:37.00] You better
[04:39.00] You can do anything you set your mind to, man
